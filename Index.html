        <h2>Childhood and family</h2>
        <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[5] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[6][7][8] but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was once a half owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[9][10] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[8][11]<br> His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,[12][13] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[14][15] The family was very wealthy in Elon's youth; Errol Musk once said, "We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe".[10][16] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,[14] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[17] Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."[17] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[12][18] Elon attended an Anglican Sunday school in his youth.[19]
<br>
Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.[20][21] He learned computer programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[22][23] An awkward and introverted child,[24] Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.[17][25] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[27] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[28][29] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[30] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[31] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber-mill.[32] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[33][34] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.<br>

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.[39] In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California.[40] Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his inquiries.[28] He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.[41]

        <h2>Tesla
        </h2>
        <p>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.[92] Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[93] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[94][95] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[96]<br> Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007 and the 2008 financial crisis, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[97][98] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[99] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[100][101] As of 2019, Elon Musk was the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[102] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to Technoking while retaining his position as CEO.<br>

Tesla first built an electric sports car, the Roadster, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[104] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012;[105] a cross-over, the Model X was launched in 2015.[106][107] A mass market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[108][109] As of March 2020, it is the world's best-selling electric car, with more than 500,000 units delivered.[110] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020.[111] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019.[112] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle subassembly factories, such as Gigafactory 1 in Nevada and Gigafactory 3 in China.[113][114][115]</p>
